      <img src="images/profile_picture.jpg" alt="Pauls Profile Picture" class="profile-picture">

      <p>I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 2 years of experience building web applications from the frontend to the backend. I specialize in writing clean, maintainable code and delivering user-friendly, scalable solutions.</p>

      <p>My work spans the entire development lifecycle â€” from designing APIs and building interfaces to deploying and maintaining systems using modern DevOps workflows.
      I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with technology and continuously learning new tools, frameworks, and best practices to stay sharp in a fast-evolving field.</p>

      <p>Im set to graduate in 2026 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Cincinnati. Some things on campus that I like to be a part of outside of school- I am a founder of the Phi Delta Theta Chapter at UC, once serving as the Philathropy and Community Service Chairman for 2 years. For fun, I attend a community organization called Campus Outreach outside of my time in class.</p>
